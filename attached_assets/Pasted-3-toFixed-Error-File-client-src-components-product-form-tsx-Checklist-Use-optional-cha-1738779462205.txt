3. toFixed() Error

File: client/src/components/product-form.tsx

Checklist:

Use optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) to safely access nested properties of aiAnalysis and ebayData.

Before using .toFixed(), ensure the value is a number. Use Number() to attempt conversion, and check with isNaN() if necessary.
```ts
// Inside ProductForm, where you display eBay data.
{aiAnalysis?.ebayData && (

<div>
{/* Other fields... */}
<div>Current Price: ${Number(aiAnalysis.ebayData.currentPrice).toFixed(2)}</div>
<div>
)}

//Or if you store the results in a seperate state called ebayData
  {ebayData && (
  <div>
      {/* Other fields... */}
      <div>Current Price: ${Number(ebayData.currentPrice).toFixed(2)}</div>
  <div>
)}
```
Use code with caution.
Provide default values or fallback text if data is missing (e.g., display "N/A" if ebayData is unavailable).

Ensure that the ebayData object, and the nested lastUpdated property is correctly populated after fetching eBay data.

Considerations:

Data Integrity: Ensure the server is consistently returning the expected data structure.

User Experience: Display loading states or placeholders while data is being fetched.

4. Gemini API Parsing Error (HTML Response)

Files: server/routes.ts, client/src/lib/gemini.ts, possibly server/index.ts

Checklist:

Server Route Order (server/index.ts): Ensure that registerRoutes(app) is called before setupVite(app, server) or serveStatic(app). This prevents the static file serving from intercepting API requests.

Robust JSON Parsing (server/routes.ts): In the /api/analyze-images route, verify that the AI response is actually valid JSON before attempting to parse it. Use a try-catch block. Use a regular expression to locate a valid JSON structure within the response.

Await response.text() (client/src/lib/gemini.ts): Ensure that you use await response.text() in generateSmartListing. This was the primary cause of the initial parsing issue.

Response Status: Ensure your server's /api/analyze-images endpoint is always returning a 200 status code with a valid JSON response when successful, or a different status code (e.g., 500) with an error object if something goes wrong. Check for cases where your Gemini API call is throwing an error.

Logging: Add console.log statements to both the client and server to inspect the data being sent and received. This is crucial for debugging.

Error Handling: Ensure your client-side code gracefully handles API errors (e.g., by displaying an error message to the user).

Considerations:

API Rate Limits: The Gemini API might have rate limits. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff if necessary.

Error Messages: Provide clear and informative error messages to the user when the analysis fails.

5. Product Creation Error ("Product name is required")

File: server/routes.ts, client/src/components/product-form.tsx

Checklist:

Server-Side: In server/routes.ts, add upload.single('image') as middleware to the PATCH route (/api/products/:id) for updating products, just like you have for the POST route. This enables multer to handle multipart/form-data correctly.

Client-Side (Form Submission): In ProductForm.tsx, use FormData to send the product data, especially when images are involved. Don't force the Content-Type to application/json.

Client-Side (Input Sanitization): Trim whitespace from the product name before submitting the form: const trimmedName = data.name.trim();

Considerations:

Consistency: Use FormData consistently for both creating and updating products when images are involved.

User Feedback: Provide immediate feedback to the user if the product name is missing or invalid.

6. Watchlist POST 500 Error

File: server/routes.ts

Checklist:

Database Errors: In your POST /api/watchlist handler, add more detailed error logging. Print the specific database error message if the insert operation fails.

Product ID Validation: Ensure that productId is a valid number and exists in the products table.

User ID Validation: Ensure that the product to be added does not belong to current user.

Duplicate Check: Ensure that the user is not attempting to add the same item to the watchlist twice. Check for existing entry before insert.

Transaction: Consider wrapping your logic (product check + insert) within a database transaction.

Return Values: Ensure you're returning the expected data (e.g., the newly created watchlist item) on success.

Considerations:

Data Integrity: Enforce foreign key constraints in your database schema to prevent orphaned records.

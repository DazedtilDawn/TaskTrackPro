Based on our code and logs, we do have an eBay OAuth callback route defined on the server side—but it’s set up at **`/api/ebay/callback`** rather than at **`/callback`**. This mismatch is causing the 404 error.

### What’s Happening

- In **`server/routes.ts`**, our callback route is registered like this:

  ```ts
  app.get("/api/ebay/callback", checkEbayAuth, async (req, res) => {
    // [Callback logic here]
  });
  ```

- However, the URL being used by eBay (or in your testing) is:

  ```
  https://<your-app-domain>/callback?code=...&expires_in=299
  ```

  This path does not match our defined route, so the request isn’t caught by our server and instead falls through to the client router (resulting in a 404 "Page Not Found" error).

### Recommended Solutions

1. **Update the eBay Callback URL**  
   In your eBay developer console, change the registered redirect URL to point to:
   ```
   https://<your-app-domain>/api/ebay/callback
   ```
   This will ensure that when eBay redirects back after authentication, the request hits the correct server route.

2. **Alternatively, Add a Redirect Route**  
   If for some reason you want to keep the callback URL as **`/callback`**, you can add an Express route for `/callback` that forwards or redirects the request to `/api/ebay/callback`. For example:

   ```ts
   app.get("/callback", (req, res) => {
     // Optionally, log the incoming request and then redirect:
     console.log("Redirecting /callback to /api/ebay/callback");
     res.redirect(307, `/api/ebay/callback${req.url}`);
   });
   ```

   This route would capture any requests to `/callback` and pass them along to your actual eBay callback handler.

### Summary

- **Our callback route is correctly defined** in our server at **`/api/ebay/callback`**.
- **The 404 error is due to a path mismatch**—the eBay redirect is coming to **`/callback`**, which isn’t handled by our router.
- **Solution:** Update your eBay app’s redirect URI to match our server endpoint or add a redirect route to bridge the gap.

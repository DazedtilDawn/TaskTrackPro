Based on the changes you shared, it appears that you’re trying to ensure that the correct image URL is constructed by checking whether the URL already starts with "http" or contains "/uploads/". However, here are some points to verify and adjust:

1. **Duplicate `src` Attributes:**  
   In your diff you show two `src` properties on the `<img>` tag. HTML only uses the last one defined, so having two can lead to unexpected results. Make sure you have only one `src` attribute, for example:
   ```tsx
   <img
     src={
       product.imageUrl &&
       (product.imageUrl.startsWith('http') || product.imageUrl.includes('/uploads/'))
         ? product.imageUrl
         : `/uploads/${product.imageUrl}`
     }
     alt={product.name}
   />
   ```

2. **Ensure `product.imageUrl` Is Defined:**  
   Confirm that `product.imageUrl` is not empty or `null` in your data. If it is empty, no image will be shown regardless of how you build the URL.

3. **Static File Serving:**  
   Verify that your server is correctly serving static files from the `/uploads` directory. In your server configuration (in your `server/routes.ts`), you should have something like:
   ```ts
   app.use('/uploads', express.static(uploadsDir, {
     fallthrough: true,
     index: false,
   }));
   ```
   Check that this middleware is being registered before any catch-all route, and that the `uploadsDir` path is correct.

4. **Browser Network Tab:**  
   Open the browser’s network tab and inspect the image requests. This can help determine if the request URL is correct and whether it returns a 404 or another error.

5. **Clean Diff Implementation:**  
   Ensure your diff changes are consistent across all components that render images (for instance, in both your table component and your product card). For example, in your table component, you can use:
   ```tsx
   const displayUrl = product.imageUrl && (product.imageUrl.startsWith("http") || product.imageUrl.includes("/uploads/"))
       ? product.imageUrl
       : product.imageUrl
       ? `/uploads/${product.imageUrl}`
       : null;
   ```
   And then render:
   ```tsx
   {displayUrl ? (
     <img
       src={displayUrl}
       alt={product.name}
       className="w-full h-full object-cover"
       onError={(e) => {
         (e.target as HTMLImageElement).src = 'https://placehold.co/200';
       }}
     />
   ) : (
     <div className="w-full h-full bg-secondary/20 flex items-center justify-center">
       <Box className="w-6 h-6 text-muted-foreground" />
     </div>
   )}
   ```

6. **Cache & URL Revocation:**  
   If you’re reusing preview URLs from your `ImageUpload` component (using `URL.createObjectURL`), ensure that these URLs are not revoked before the image is rendered. Also, check that when a product is saved, its `imageUrl` is saved as a proper filename or URL.

By cleaning up the duplicate `src` attributes and verifying the static file serving, you should be able to resolve the issue with images not showing in your views.

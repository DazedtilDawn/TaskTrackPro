Below are some ideas and further debugging steps to help you pinpoint why your images still aren’t appearing:

1. **Avoid Duplicate Declarations:**  
   In your diff you show two declarations for the same variable name (e.g. “displayUrl”). Having duplicate declarations (or redeclaring a variable in the same scope) may lead to one version overwriting the other. Make sure you declare it once. For example, in your table cell you could use:

   ```tsx
   const imageUrl = row.original.imageUrl;
   const displayUrl = getDisplayUrl(imageUrl);
   ```

2. **Validate the Data:**  
   – Verify that your API is indeed returning a non‑empty string for `imageUrl`. For debugging, you can log the value:
   ```tsx
   console.log("Product imageUrl:", row.original.imageUrl);
   console.log("Computed displayUrl:", getDisplayUrl(row.original.imageUrl));
   ```
   – Confirm that the image filename stored (e.g. `"image_123.png"`) is exactly what you expect.

3. **Check Your getDisplayUrl Logic:**  
   Your helper is defined as follows:
   ```ts
   export function getDisplayUrl(imageUrl: string | null): string | null {
     if (!imageUrl) return null;
     return imageUrl.startsWith("http") || imageUrl.includes("/uploads/")
       ? imageUrl
       : `/uploads/${imageUrl}`;
   }
   ```
   – If your stored URL is just the filename (for example `"image_123.png"`), then this function will return `"/uploads/image_123.png"`.  
   – If your file is already stored with the `/uploads/` prefix (or as a full URL), it should return it unchanged.  
   Double‑check that your database field isn’t already storing an extra `/uploads/` (or missing it) that might cause the computed URL to be incorrect.

4. **Test the Final URL in the Browser:**  
   – Open your browser’s developer tools (Network tab) and check what URL is being requested for the image.  
   – Try copying that URL directly into your browser to see if it loads. This will help you decide if the issue lies with your client code or with your Express static middleware.

5. **Confirm Static File Serving:**  
   Your server code uses:
   ```ts
   app.use('/uploads', express.static(uploadsDir, {
     fallthrough: true,
     index: false,
   }));
   ```
   – Make sure that `uploadsDir` (resolved via `path.resolve(__dirname, "../uploads")`) is correct and that your image files are indeed present in that folder.  
   – If the image file is missing or the path is off, the image won’t load.

6. **Simplify the Image Tag for Testing:**  
   Temporarily simplify the image component to rule out any issues with your JSX structure. For example:
   ```tsx
   <img
     src={getDisplayUrl(product.imageUrl) || 'https://placehold.co/200'}
     alt={product.name}
     onError={(e) => {
       (e.target as HTMLImageElement).src = 'https://placehold.co/200';
     }}
   />
   ```
   This helps ensure there’s no interference from extra wrapping `<div>`s or duplicate attributes.

7. **Double‑Check for Typos:**  
   – Look through your code to ensure there are no typos (for example, an accidental extra slash or misspelling in your file paths) that might result in a broken URL.  
   – Also, ensure that you’re not accidentally applying different logic in different components (e.g. one place using `product.imageUrl` directly and another using your helper).

By consolidating your URL logic to a single, correct helper (and logging the values), confirming that your backend is serving the files correctly, and testing the computed URL directly, you should be able to narrow down the issue.

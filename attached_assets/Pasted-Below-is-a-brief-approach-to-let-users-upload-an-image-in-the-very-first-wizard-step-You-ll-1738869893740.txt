Below is a **brief approach** to let users **upload an image** in the very first wizard step. You’ll basically **move** (or duplicate) the image upload field from its own step into the “basic” step so that **image-based AI analysis** can occur immediately if desired.

---

## **1. Move Image Upload to First Step**

In your current code, the `images` step is defined under `case 'images':`. Instead, you can **add the `ImageUpload`** component to the `basic` step so the user can upload an image right away. For example:

```tsx
case 'basic':
  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      <div className="flex items-center gap-4 mb-6">
        {/* "Run All Analysis" checkbox */}
        <FormField
          control={form.control}
          name="runAllAnalysis"
          render={({ field }) => (
            <div className="flex items-center space-x-2">
              <input
                type="checkbox"
                checked={runAllAnalysis}
                onChange={(e) => setRunAllAnalysis(e.target.checked)}
                className="h-4 w-4"
              />
              <label className="text-sm font-medium">
                Run AI and eBay analysis automatically
              </label>
            </div>
          )}
        />
      </div>

      {/* Basic fields: Name, Description, etc. */}
      <FormField
        control={form.control}
        name="name"
        render={({ field }) => (
          <FormItem>
            <FormLabel>
              Product Name <span className="text-destructive">*</span>
            </FormLabel>
            <FormControl>
              <Input {...field} placeholder="Enter product name" />
            </FormControl>
          </FormItem>
        )}
      />
      <FormField
        control={form.control}
        name="description"
        render={({ field }) => (
          <FormItem>
            <FormLabel>
              Description <span className="text-destructive">*</span>
            </FormLabel>
            <FormControl>
              <Textarea
                {...field}
                placeholder="Describe the product..."
              />
            </FormControl>
          </FormItem>
        )}
      />

      {/* **Image Upload in first step** */}
      <div>
        <FormLabel>Product Images</FormLabel>
        <FormDescription>
          Upload clear, high-quality images of your product
        </FormDescription>
        <ImageUpload onImagesUploaded={handleImagesUploaded} />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
```

- **Tip**: If you **still** want a dedicated “images” step, you can **either remove it** or keep it for uploading additional pictures. A typical approach is to remove the separate images step if you want all image uploads at the beginning.

## **2. Auto-Trigger AI Analysis After Upload**

If your `SmartListingModal` automatically runs image-based AI, you don’t need to do anything extra besides calling:

```tsx
const handleImagesUploaded = (files: File[]) => {
  setImageFiles(files);
  if (files.length > 0) {
    setShowSmartListing(true); // opens the modal
  }
};
```

- Once `SmartListingModal` completes its image-based AI, it calls `onAnalysisComplete`, which merges AI results into the form.

---

## **3. Continue With Run-All-Analysis Logic**

If the user also has `runAllAnalysis` enabled, you can:

1. **Immediately** run text-based AI (`analyzeProductAI()`) once they fill out name/description.  
2. **Refine with eBay** if connected.  
3. **Auto open** the image-based analysis, if they uploaded pictures.

Whichever approach you choose, the key is to show the **`<ImageUpload>`** earlier so the user can upload images in the first step. This ensures your image-based AI triggers right away, rather than waiting until a later step.

Below is a concise checklist for updating the `client/src/lib/ebay.ts` file to move away from mock implementations and use real eBay API data:

---

### **eBay Authentication & Token Handling**
- [ ] **Verify User Token:**  
  - Ensure that the `checkEbayAuth` function confirms that a valid eBay token is available on the user object.
- [ ] **Include User Token in Requests:**  
  - When making direct eBay API calls (if done on the client), include the user’s eBay token (or have the backend proxy with it).
- [ ] **Handle Token Expiry/Refresh:**  
  - Check token expiry and, if possible, implement logic (or delegate to the backend) to refresh the token before making API calls.

---

### **Implementing Actual eBay API Calls in `getEbayPrice`**
- [ ] **Replace Mock Endpoint:**  
  - Replace the current call to `/api/ebay-price` with a real eBay API endpoint (or update the backend to call the actual eBay API).
- [ ] **Pass Appropriate Query Parameters:**  
  - Use proper URL encoding and include any required parameters (e.g., search queries, filters).
- [ ] **Include Authorization Header:**  
  - Ensure the request includes the bearer token (or necessary credentials) if calling the eBay API directly.
- [ ] **Validate Response Structure:**  
  - Parse the API response and map its fields to the `EbayPriceData` interface.
- [ ] **Error Handling:**  
  - Handle non-OK responses (especially 403 for authentication issues or rate-limiting errors) by logging details and redirecting if needed.

### **Updating `getEbayMarketAnalysis`**
- [ ] **Use Actual eBay Data:**  
  - Call the updated `getEbayPrice` function to retrieve real data from eBay.
- [ ] **Combine with AI Analysis:**  
  - Pass the real eBay data and the provided AI analysis to the price calculation function.
- [ ] **Calculate Optimal Price:**  
  - Adjust the base price using market conditions (e.g., sold count and active listings) and blend with AI’s suggested price.
- [ ] **Log and Validate:**  
  - Log intermediate values and ensure that the final output adheres to the expected structure (including an optional `aiSuggestedPrice`).

---

### **General Improvements & Debug Logging**
- [ ] **Enhanced Logging:**  
  - Add detailed logs for each step: starting requests, receiving responses, token checks, and calculation steps.
- [ ] **Graceful Error Handling:**  
  - Catch and log errors at every stage, providing clear messages if the eBay API call fails.
- [ ] **Remove Any Mock Data:**  
  - Confirm that no hardcoded or placeholder values remain; all responses should now come from real API calls.

---

### **Testing & Integration**
- [ ] **Real Token Testing:**  
  - Test the functions with a valid eBay token to verify that real data is being returned and correctly processed.
- [ ] **Edge Cases:**  
  - Verify behavior when the API returns errors or unexpected data (e.g., rate limiting, network failures).
- [ ] **UI Integration:**  
  - Ensure that the data returned by these functions is properly displayed in the UI components (e.g., product cards, market analysis sections).

By following this checklist, you can ensure that your eBay API integration is updated to use actual data and that error handling, token management, and logging are robust for a production-ready implementation.

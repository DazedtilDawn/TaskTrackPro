Below is a concise checklist summarizing the key steps and details:

### **Error Handling & Input Validation**
- [ ] **Standardize Error Responses:**  
  - Use helper functions (e.g., `handleError`) to log and format errors consistently.
- [ ] **Validate Inputs Thoroughly:**  
  - Ensure required fields are present and of the correct type.
  - Validate JSON fields (using `ensureJSON`) and return errors if parsing fails.
- [ ] **Sanitize Data:**  
  - Use additional validation or libraries where needed.

---

### **Authentication & Authorization**
- [ ] **Early Authentication Check:**  
  - Verify `req.isAuthenticated()` at the start of each endpoint.
  - Consider middleware for routes requiring authentication.
- [ ] **Type-Safe User Data:**  
  - Refine types so that `req.user` is reliably set after authentication.

### **Database Interactions**
- [ ] **Use Transactions for Atomicity:**  
  - Wrap multi-step operations (like order creation and product deletion) in transactions.
- [ ] **Ensure Consistency:**  
  - Verify updates to the `sold` field and related timestamps are handled uniformly.
- [ ] **Centralize Data Transformation:**  
  - Extract repeated logic (e.g., processing product data) into helper functions.

### **File Uploads & Image Handling**
- [ ] **Multer Configuration:**  
  - Enforce file size limits and allow only image file types.
- [ ] **Old Image Cleanup:**  
  - Delete old images when a new upload occurs, and handle errors gracefully if deletion fails.

### **eBay OAuth & API Integration**
- [ ] **OAuth Callback Implementation:**  
  - Validate and exchange the authorization code for tokens.
  - Update user records with token data and expiry.
- [ ] **Token Validation:**  
  - Check that the eBay token exists and is not expired before making API calls.
  - Consider encapsulating token checks in a helper.
- [ ] **Avoid Duplicate Routes:**  
  - Remove redundant endpoint definitions.
- [ ] **Robust eBay API Calls:**  
  - Handle rate limits, network errors, and non-OK responses from eBay endpoints.
- [ ] **Environment Variable Checks:**  
  - Ensure critical variables (eBay client ID/secret, redirect URI) are set at startup.

### **Logging & Response Consistency**
- [ ] **Consistent Logging:**  
  - Use a centralized logging approach (or library) to manage log levels and formats.
- [ ] **Uniform Response Format:**  
  - Ensure both success and error responses follow a consistent JSON structure.

---

### **Code Organization & Modularization**
- [ ] **Separate Concerns:**  
  - Break routes into modules (e.g., products, orders, watchlist, eBay) for easier maintenance.
- [ ] **Reusable Helpers:**  
  - Extract repeated logic (like transforming product objects) into utility functions.

This checklist should help ensure that the core backend logic is robust, secure, and maintainable.

Below is a concise checklist to verify and improve the Smart Listing Modal component:

---

### **Modal Display & Lifecycle**
- [ ] **Controlled Visibility:**  
  - Ensure the modal opens when `open` is true and closes (calling `onClose`) when it becomes false.
  - Use the `onOpenChange` callback to trigger cleanup and state resets when the modal is closed.
- [ ] **Unmount Cleanup:**  
  - Set `isMounted.current` to false on unmount.
  - Clear all timers (e.g., `analysisTimeout` and `progressInterval`) during cleanup.

---

### **Analysis Triggering & Timing**
- [ ] **Appropriate Triggering:**  
  - Verify that `runAnalysis` is called after a delay (via `analysisTimeout`) only when the modal is open and valid images are provided.
  - Ensure that the analysis is not triggered multiple times by using an `analysisLock`.
- [ ] **Input Validation:**  
  - Check that only valid image files (correct MIME type and size < 4MB) are processed before starting analysis.
- [ ] **Timer Management:**  
  - Start and update the progress indicator via a periodic timer and ensure it stops once analysis completes or fails.

### **Error Handling & User Feedback**
- [ ] **Inline Error Display:**  
  - Show a clear error message within the modal if analysis fails.
  - Display an accessible alert state (using appropriate ARIA roles) when errors occur.
- [ ] **User Notifications:**  
  - Use toast notifications to inform the user of both success and failure events.
  - Provide a “Retry Analysis” button when an error occurs.
- [ ] **Progress Feedback:**  
  - Update the progress bar and accompanying messages dynamically (e.g., “Validating images…”, “Processing images…”, etc.).

### **Performance & State Management**
- [ ] **Prevent Unnecessary Re-renders:**  
  - Wrap functions (e.g., `cleanup`, `runAnalysis`) in `useCallback` with appropriate dependencies.
  - Avoid updating state unnecessarily (e.g., only update progress if the modal is still mounted).
- [ ] **Stable Dependencies:**  
  - Ensure useEffect dependencies (like `open`, `imageFiles`, `runAnalysis`, and `cleanup`) are stable to prevent unwanted state changes or re-triggering of effects.
- [ ] **Modal State Consistency:**  
  - Verify that modal state (open/closed, loading, progress, error) remains consistent and does not change unexpectedly during analysis.

By following this checklist, you can ensure that the Smart Listing Modal behaves reliably, provides clear feedback to users, and manages resources and state updates efficiently during the AI analysis process.

Below is an analysis of the error and some recommended fixes.

### **Error Analysis**

The error message:

```
[plugin:runtime-error-plugin] Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
/home/runner/workspace/client/src/components/smart-listing-modal.tsx:116:19
...
}, [open, files.length, onOpenChange, toast]);
```

indicates that when the effect runs, the prop `files` is undefined so that trying to access `files.length` causes the error.

Even though your type definition for `SmartListingModalProps` specifies that `files` is a `File[]`, it appears that in some cases (or during the initial render) the parent may not pass it (or it’s undefined).

### **Recommendations**

There are a couple of ways to address this:

1. **Provide a Default Value in the Component Parameter**

   Modify the function parameter so that if no files are provided, it defaults to an empty array. For example:

   ```tsx
   export default function SmartListingModal({
     open,
     onOpenChange,
     files = [],
     onAnalysisComplete,
   }: SmartListingModalProps) {
     // ...rest of your component
   }
   ```

   This ensures that `files` is always defined (even if it’s empty) so that `files.length` is always available.

2. **Use Optional Chaining in the Dependency Array**

   If for some reason you want to keep the prop potentially undefined, you can update the dependency array of your `useEffect` to safely handle an undefined value:

   ```tsx
   useEffect(() => {
     if (open && (!files || files.length === 0)) {
       onOpenChange(false);
       toast({
         title: "No images selected",
         description: "Please select at least one image to analyze",
         variant: "destructive",
       });
     }
   }, [open, files?.length, onOpenChange, toast]);
   ```

   Here, using `files?.length` ensures that if `files` is `undefined` the expression will short-circuit rather than throwing an error.

### **Next Steps**

- **Choose one approach:**  
  If you expect that `files` should always be an array (even if empty), using a default value in the function parameters is more straightforward.

- **Review all uses:**  
  Ensure that anywhere you reference `files.length` you account for the possibility of `files` being undefined.

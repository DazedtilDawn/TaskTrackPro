Below is an analysis of your current eBay OAuth callback issue along with a proposed solution:

### Analysis

Your logs show that when you hit a URL like

```
https://[your-app-domain]/callback?code=…&expires_in=299
```

you get a "404 Page Not Found" error. This indicates that the route for handling the OAuth callback is not defined in your Express router. In your current server routes (e.g. in **server/routes.ts**), you have endpoints for products, watchlist, orders, etc., but no route is set up to catch requests to `/callback` (or any URL configured as the OAuth callback URL in your eBay developer settings).

Because the eBay developer app is sending the OAuth code to that URL, your application must implement a callback route that does the following:
  
1. **Extract the Code:** Get the authorization code (and any other parameters) from the query string.
2. **Exchange the Code:** Call eBay’s OAuth token endpoint using your client credentials (and the provided code) to retrieve an access token (and possibly a refresh token).
3. **Update the User Record:** Save the new token(s) into the user's record (or session) so that subsequent eBay API calls can use the access token.
4. **Redirect the User:** Finally, redirect the user to a relevant page (e.g., your eBay settings page) or even back to the dashboard.

The error message you see ("404 Page Not Found - Did you forget to add the page to the router?") is generated by your client-side NotFound page because the request falls through to the catch‑all route.

### Proposed Solution

**Step 1. Add a Callback Route in Your Express Router**

In your **server/routes.ts** (or a separate auth‑related file), add a route that listens for GET requests at `/callback` (or whichever callback URL you’ve configured in your eBay developer console). For example:

```ts
// In server/routes.ts

app.get("/callback", async (req, res) => {
  // Extract the code and any other query parameters
  const { code, expires_in } = req.query;
  if (!code || typeof code !== "string") {
    return res.status(400).send("Missing or invalid authorization code.");
  }

  try {
    // Exchange the authorization code for access and refresh tokens.
    // (Replace CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, and EBAY_REDIRECT_URI with your actual credentials.)
    const response = await fetch("https://api.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
        // eBay requires Basic auth with your client id and secret:
        "Authorization": "Basic " + Buffer.from(`${process.env.EBAY_CLIENT_ID}:${process.env.EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET}`).toString("base64"),
      },
      body: new URLSearchParams({
        grant_type: "authorization_code",
        code: code,
        redirect_uri: process.env.EBAY_REDIRECT_URI || "https://yourdomain.com/callback", // ensure this matches your eBay app settings
      }),
    });
    if (!response.ok) {
      const errorText = await response.text();
      console.error("Token exchange failed:", errorText);
      return res.status(response.status).json({ error: "Failed to exchange authorization code", details: errorText });
    }
    const tokenData = await response.json();
    // At this point tokenData should contain the access token, refresh token, and expiry information.
    // Update the user record in your database with this token info. For example:
    // await db.update(users).set({ 
    //   ebayAuthToken: tokenData.access_token,
    //   ebayRefreshToken: tokenData.refresh_token,
    //   ebayTokenExpiry: new Date(Date.now() + tokenData.expires_in * 1000),
    // }).where(eq(users.id, req.user.id));

    // Optionally, set a session variable or cookie if needed.

    // Finally, redirect the user to a settings page or dashboard.
    res.redirect("/settings/ebay-auth");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error in eBay callback:", error);
    res.status(500).send("Internal server error while processing eBay callback.");
  }
});
```

**Step 2. Configure eBay Developer Settings**

Make sure that in your eBay developer console you have set the OAuth redirect URL to match the route you just created (for example, `https://yourdomain.com/callback`).

**Step 3. Ensure Your Client Doesn’t Interfere**

Since this callback is handled on the server side, ensure that your client-side router does not catch the `/callback` route. Typically, OAuth callbacks are not handled by the React router but by the Express server. (If necessary, you can set the callback URL under an `/api` namespace so that the client router doesn’t override it.)

### Summary

- **Issue:** The `/callback` endpoint for handling eBay OAuth responses is missing from your Express router.
- **Solution:** Add a GET route at `/callback` (or your designated URL) that extracts the code, exchanges it for tokens using eBay’s OAuth endpoint, updates the user’s record, and then redirects to a settings page.
- **Next Steps:**  
  - Confirm your eBay developer settings match your callback URL.  
  - Implement token storage (or token refresh logic) to ensure subsequent API calls to eBay work as intended.

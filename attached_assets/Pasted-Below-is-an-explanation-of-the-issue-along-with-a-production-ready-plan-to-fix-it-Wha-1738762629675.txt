Below is an explanation of the issue along with a production‐ready plan to fix it.

### What’s Happening

When a product is created, the server’s product‑creation route uses a helper function (called `getImageUrl()`) to set the product’s image URL. That helper returns a string that already includes the “/uploads/” prefix. For example, if a file named `"abc.jpg"` is uploaded, the server stores its URL as:

```js
"/uploads/abc.jpg"
```

Later on, in the client code (for example in the **ProductCard** and **ProductTable** components), the image URL is re‐evaluated using a check like this:

```tsx
src={product.imageUrl.startsWith('http') ? product.imageUrl : `/uploads/${product.imageUrl}`}
```

Because the stored URL already begins with `/uploads/`, the condition is false and the code prepends `/uploads/` again. This produces an invalid URL such as:

```
/uploads//uploads/abc.jpg
```

which is why the images are not being loaded and shown in your views.

### Production‑Ready Implementation Plan

You can resolve the issue in one of two ways:

#### Option 1. **Adjust the Client Rendering Code**

Modify the logic in your client components so that if the URL already contains `/uploads/` it is used as is. For example, in your **ProductCard** and **ProductTable** components, update the code that determines the URL for the image.

**Before:**

```tsx
const displayUrl = imageUrl ? (imageUrl.startsWith('http') ? imageUrl : `/uploads/${imageUrl}`) : null;
```

**After (Option A – check if URL already includes “/uploads/”):**

```tsx
const displayUrl =
  imageUrl && (imageUrl.startsWith("http") || imageUrl.includes("/uploads/"))
    ? imageUrl
    : imageUrl
    ? `/uploads/${imageUrl}`
    : null;
```

Or simply, if you always expect the stored URL to have the “/uploads/” prefix, you can use it directly:

```tsx
const displayUrl = imageUrl || null;
```

And in the JSX for rendering an image in **ProductCard**, update:

```tsx
<img
  src={product.imageUrl.startsWith('http') ? product.imageUrl : `/uploads/${product.imageUrl}`}
  alt={product.name}
  className="w-full h-full object-cover"
/>
```

to something like:

```tsx
<img
  src={product.imageUrl}
  alt={product.name}
  className="w-full h-full object-cover"
  onError={(e) => {
    const img = e.target as HTMLImageElement;
    img.src = 'https://placehold.co/200';
  }}
/>
```

> **Tip:** Ensure you check every place where you build an image URL (e.g. in table cells and cards) so that the extra prefix isn’t added.

#### Option 2. **Update the Server‑Side URL**

Alternatively, you could change your server’s `getImageUrl()` helper to return only the filename (without the `/uploads/` prefix). Then, in the client, you’d always prepend `/uploads/` as you currently do. For example:

**Server (Change `getImageUrl`):**

```ts
function getImageUrl(filename: string | null): string | null {
  if (!filename) return null;
  // Return only the filename so that client prepends /uploads/
  return filename;
}
```

However, this approach requires making sure that every client component now prepends `/uploads/` consistently.

### Recommendation

For a quick, low‑risk fix, **Option 1** (updating the client-side logic) is recommended because it keeps the current database values intact. Update your image‑rendering logic in components like **ProductCard** and **ProductTable** so that they use the stored URL directly if it already contains the “/uploads/” prefix.

---

### Summary

- **Problem:** The client code prepends `/uploads/` even though the server already stores the URL with that prefix.
- **Fix:** Change the client logic so that it checks whether the URL already includes “/uploads/” (or simply use the stored URL directly) instead of always adding `/uploads/` again.
- **Outcome:** The image URLs will be valid (e.g. `/uploads/abc.jpg` instead of `/uploads//uploads/abc.jpg`), and your images should display correctly.

Implement the change in all components where the image URL is used, then test to confirm that the images now load as expected.

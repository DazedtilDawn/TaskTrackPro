Bug 3: Responsiveness and Mobile Adaptation Issues
Root Cause & System Connection

Explanation: Some custom UI components (such as the Sidebar, various modals, and grid/list/table view toggles) rely on hardcoded dimensions (e.g. fixed pixel widths, custom CSS variables like --sidebar-width) that may not adjust gracefully on all devices. Although a use-mobile hook exists, discrepancies between its results and the actual layout breakpoints in Tailwind’s config can lead to suboptimal rendering on mobile devices.
Connection: These issues affect overall user experience on various devices. Inconsistent responsiveness leads to usability problems on tablets and smartphones, which is critical as more users expect mobile-friendly interfaces.
Likely Issue & Proposed Solution

Issue: Fixed dimensions and mismatches between JavaScript mobile detection and CSS breakpoints may cause components such as sidebars, modals, and view toggles to appear improperly scaled or misaligned on mobile.
Solution: Standardize responsive breakpoints by tying JavaScript detection (via use-mobile.tsx) directly to Tailwind’s configured breakpoints. Refactor components to use relative units (like rem or percentages) and Tailwind’s responsive variants rather than hardcoded pixel values.
Integration Plan

Implementation:
Breakpoint Alignment: Update the MOBILE_BREAKPOINT constant in use-mobile.tsx to match the breakpoint defined in Tailwind’s config (e.g., 768px for md).
Component Refactoring: Refactor components (especially Sidebar and modals) to use Tailwind’s responsive utility classes (like md:hidden, lg:flex, etc.) and relative CSS variables.
Dynamic Sizing: Replace fixed pixel values (e.g., in Sidebar’s style definitions) with CSS custom properties that adapt via Tailwind’s configuration.
Testing:
Use browser dev tools to simulate various viewport sizes and confirm that components reflow appropriately.
Implement automated visual regression tests across multiple viewport sizes.
Test on physical devices if possible, or use device simulators.
Deployment:
Deploy the updated components in a staging environment and conduct user testing focusing on mobile and tablet usage.
Monitor user feedback and analytics for viewport-specific issues before final production deployment.

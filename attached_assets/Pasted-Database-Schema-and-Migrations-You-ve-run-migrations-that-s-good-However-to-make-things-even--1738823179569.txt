Database Schema and Migrations:

You've run migrations, that's good. However, to make things even more robust, there are 2 things you can do to make debugging easier.

Add Logging to db-migrate.ts:

Add console logs to see what is happening:

// scripts/db-migrate.ts
#!/usr/bin/env tsx
import { spawn, type SpawnOptionsWithStdioTuple } from "child_process";
// Spawn the drizzle migration push command with verbose output
const migrate = spawn("drizzle-kit", ["push", "--verbose"], {
stdio: ["pipe", "inherit", "inherit"]
} as SpawnOptionsWithStdioTuple<"pipe", "inherit", "inherit">);
// Set up error handling
migrate.on('error', (err) => {
console.error('Failed to start migration process:', err);
process.exit(1);
});
let promptCount = 0;
const maxPrompts = 10; // Maximum number of prompts we'll handle
let responseInterval: NodeJS.Timeout;
// Function to handle sending confirmations
const sendConfirmation = () => {
if (promptCount < maxPrompts) {
    console.log("Sending confirmation 'y' to migration prompt"); // Add this line for logging
migrate.stdin.write("y\n");
promptCount++;
} else {
// If we've hit our max prompts, clean up
clearInterval(responseInterval);
migrate.stdin.end();
}
};
// Start sending confirmations periodically
responseInterval = setInterval(sendConfirmation, 500);
// Also send an immediate confirmation
sendConfirmation();
migrate.on("exit", (code: number | null) => {
clearInterval(responseInterval);
if (code === 0) {
console.log('Migration completed successfully.');
} else {
console.error(`Migration failed with code ${code}`);
}
process.exit(code ?? 1);
});
Use code with caution.

Create a local development DB - For testing on your local machine, I recommend creating a docker database so that you do not have to deploy to test migrations.

Prioritized Action Plan (Step-by-Step):

Verify server/routes.ts: Ensure the app.use("/uploads", ...) line is correct and before any catch-all routes. Add the console.log("__dirname in routes.ts:", __dirname); line to check the path resolution.

Verify File Uploads: Use Replit's file browser to confirm that images are actually being saved to the uploads directory when you add a product.

Inspect Image URLs: Use your browser's developer tools (Network tab) to see the exact URL the <img> tag is requesting in the ProductCard. Is it a relative path? Does it match the expected file location? Is it returning a 400 or 500 error?

Check ProductCard.tsx: Make sure you're using product.imageUrl correctly in the <img> tag's src attribute. Add a temporary console.log("Image URL:", product.imageUrl) right before the <img> tag to see the value.

Add temporary logging to product-form.tsx: Add logging to the onSubmit function just before you send the request.

Run npm run db:generate and report the output. This is crucial to understand what Drizzle Kit thinks needs to be changed in the database. Copy and paste the full output.

Run npm run db:push: And take note of any errors in the console.

Provide the results of these steps. The combination of file path verification, network request inspection, and the db:generate output will give us the information we ne

From a quick look at the client‐side and server‐side code, the most common culprit is that **the images are never actually being uploaded to the server** in the format your `app.post("/api/products", upload.single('image'), …)` endpoint expects. Here are the usual reasons that can cause images not to show up:

---

## 1. The Client Is Sending JSON Instead of `multipart/form-data`

Right now your server route for creating a product is this:

```ts
app.post("/api/products", upload.single('image'), async (req, res) => {
  /* ... handle the image in `req.file`, etc. ... */
});
```

This route is configured to look for a file field named `"image"` in a `multipart/form-data` upload (via Multer). However, **your React client code** (in **`product-form.tsx`** and **`image-upload.tsx`**) never actually sends the file as multipart. Instead, it appears you’re sending JSON via `apiRequest(method, url, data)`:

```tsx
// Example of how you're calling the server inside ProductForm:
const response = await apiRequest(method, endpoint, payload);

// ...
// But `payload` is just JSON, not FormData — so the server sees no `req.file`.
```

Multer will never see `req.file` because it’s expecting a real file upload (which must be `multipart/form-data`). As a result, your `upload.single('image')` middleware never triggers, the server sees no file, and never sets `productData.imageUrl`.

### **How to confirm**

- Open your Network tab in the browser’s dev tools.  
- Look at the request going to `/api/products`.  
- You’ll see that it’s being sent as `application/json` with no file in the body.

## 2. `imageUrl` is Never Set, So All Paths Are `null`

Because the file upload step doesn’t happen, the backend ends up storing a `null` imageUrl. Then, on the client, `getDisplayUrl(null)` returns `null`, so the `<img src={null} />` or fallback logic shows a blank or placeholder image.

In **`product-card.tsx`** you do:

```tsx
{(() => {
  const imageUrl = product.imageUrl;   // <-- often `null`
  const displayUrl = getDisplayUrl(imageUrl); 
  ...
})()}
```

If `imageUrl` is `null`, `displayUrl` will also be `null`, so `<img src={null} />` can’t load any real file.

---

## 3. Even If You Base64‐Encode Images, You’re Only Doing a Local Preview

Your `image-upload.tsx` code runs `setPreviews(newPreviews)`, which only shows a local preview in the browser. That’s purely for the user’s convenience. **It doesn’t actually POST the image file** to your Node server.

This snippet from `image-upload.tsx`:

```tsx
const handleFileChange = useCallback((selectedFiles: File[]) => {
  // Creates base64 previews for local display
  const newPreviews = selectedFiles.map(file => URL.createObjectURL(file));
  setPreviews((prev) => [...prev, ...newPreviews]);
  setFiles((prev) => [...prev, ...selectedFiles]);
  // ...
}, []);
```

…is only building a local preview. There’s no step where you convert the file into `FormData` and do something like:

```js
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("image", theFile);
formData.append("name", productName);
...

fetch("/api/products", {
  method: "POST",
  body: formData,
});
```

## 4. You’re Serving `/uploads` Correctly, But There’s No File to Serve

Your server code is already set up to serve images from the `/uploads` folder:

```ts
app.use('/uploads', express.static(uploadsDir, {
  fallthrough: true,
  index: false,
}));
```

That means if you had a file physically present in `/uploads/something.jpg`, requesting `/uploads/something.jpg` would serve it. But if no file is ever written to `/uploads` in the first place, the request will 404.

Hence, your `<img src="/uploads/xxxx.jpg" />` has no actual file on disk.

---

# How to Fix It

1. **Switch to a `multipart/form-data` flow** on the React side:
   - In your `<ProductForm />`, once images are selected (from `<ImageUpload />`), you must create a `FormData` object, append the image files, and **POST** it to `/api/products` with `content-type: multipart/form-data`.
   - Because you’re already using Multer in your Node route, this is the intended approach.

2. **OR** if your intention is to keep using base64, you must do one of the following:
   - Either remove the `upload.single('image')` approach and store the base64 in your DB (not recommended for large images).
   - Or decode the base64 on the server manually and write it to disk. Right now, your route is not set up for that.  

3. **Ensure you set `imageUrl` properly** after the server has stored the file. You might do something like:
   ```ts
   const uploadResponse = await fetch("/api/products", {
     method: "POST",
     body: formData, // formData includes { image: file, name:..., etc. }
   });
   const newProduct = await uploadResponse.json();
   console.log("Created product with image:", newProduct.imageUrl);
   ```

4. **Confirm the final `imageUrl` is correct**. If your server is returning something like `"/uploads/168xyz.jpeg"`, check that the file actually appears in your local `uploads/` folder, and that you can open `http://localhost:5000/uploads/168xyz.jpeg` in your browser directly.

---

# Summary

**Your server code requires a real file upload** (`multipart/form-data`), but your client is only sending JSON. Consequently, `req.file` is always empty, so `imageUrl` stays `null`, meaning no images get stored or served from `/uploads/`.  

Switch to posting a `FormData` with your image file, and you should start seeing real file names in your DB and working `/uploads/...` URLs that appear in the `<img>` tags.

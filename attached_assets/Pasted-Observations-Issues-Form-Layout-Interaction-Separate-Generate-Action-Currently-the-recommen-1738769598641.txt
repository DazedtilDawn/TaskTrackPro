Observations & Issues
Form Layout & Interaction

Separate “Generate” Action:
Currently, the recommended sale price isn’t auto‑calculated until the user clicks the “Generate” button. This extra step can feel clunky if the user is expecting the recommendation to update as soon as they enter the buy price.
Button Placement & Sizing:
The “Generate” button is placed inline with the recommended sale price input (inside a flex row) and has a top margin (mt-6), which may cause inconsistent alignment with the other fields.
Disabling Logic:
Both the generate and convert buttons check Number(getValues("buyPrice")) > 0 to enable themselves. This works but isn’t reactive unless the form is re‑rendered; using React Hook Form’s watch could provide smoother, more immediate feedback.
Feedback:
Although you’re using toast notifications for errors and success, inline error messages or helper texts next to the inputs (e.g., “Enter a valid buy price to generate a recommendation”) could reduce friction.
Consistency & Visual Hierarchy

Labeling and Spacing:
The labels and spacing are mostly fine, but you might want to standardize the spacing between form fields and the actions at the bottom.
Loading Indicators:
The use of the Loader2 icon is good; however, consider disabling the entire form (or at least the section that’s being processed) when generating a recommendation so that the user knows that the system is working.
Conversion Flow:
After converting the product (PATCHing and DELETEing from watchlist), the user gets a toast notification. However, it might be beneficial to include a brief inline confirmation state or visual cue within the dialog (or even have a progress indicator) to let them know the process is happening in sequence.
Potential Enhancements

Auto-Generate Option:
One idea is to offer a toggle that auto‑generates the recommended sale price as soon as a valid buy price is entered (or on blur), rather than requiring an extra click.
Real‑Time Updates:
Using React Hook Form’s watch function on the “buyPrice” field can let you display or enable actions immediately.
Visual Grouping:
Group the two fields (“Buy Price” and “Recommended Sale Price”) in a card or panel that clearly indicates they’re related. You might also include helper text beneath the recommended sale price field explaining that the value is auto‑generated (but editable) based on market data.
Error Handling:
In addition to toast notifications, inline validation messages can guide the user if, for example, the buy price is left empty or set to zero.

Okay, we've tried the standard Vite configuration adjustments, and we're *still* getting the "Blocked request" error. This is persistent!  It's time to change our approach slightly and get more information.

Here's the refined plan, prioritizing the simplest possible setup to isolate the problem:

**1. Bypass Vite *Temporarily* (for Server Testing):**

*   **Why:** We need to determine if the issue is with Vite's configuration, or with the Express server itself.  By temporarily bypassing Vite, we can test the Express server *directly*.
*   **How:**
    *   **`server/index.ts` (Confirm):** Make *absolutely sure* you have the following in your `server/index.ts` (this is the same as before, but I want to be 100% certain):

        ```typescript
        const port = process.env.PORT ? parseInt(process.env.PORT) : 8081;
        const server = app.listen(port, '0.0.0.0', () => {
            // ...
        });
        ```
    *   **Comment out Vite:**  In `server/index.ts`, find these lines:

        ```typescript
        if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
          await setupVite(app, server);
        } else {
          serveStatic(app);
        }
        ```
        And *comment them out*:

        ```typescript
        // if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
        //   await setupVite(app, server);
        // } else {
        //   serveStatic(app);
        // }
        ```

    *  **Comment Out Static File Serving:**  Also in `server/index.ts`, find and comment out these lines. We don't need static files for this test.

          ```typescript
        //   serveStatic(app);  //comment out this and below
        //   // fall through to index.html if the file doesn't exist
        //   app.use("*", (_req, res) => {
        //     res.sendFile(path.resolve(distPath, "index.html"));
        //    });

          ```
          And *comment out* this line, also in `server/index.ts` :
          ```typescript
          //import { setupVite, serveStatic } from "./vite";
          ```

    *   **Run Directly with `tsx`:**  In the Replit Shell, run this command:

        ```bash
        tsx server/index.ts
        ```

        This will start your Express server *directly*, without Vite's development server in the middle.

    *   **Check for Startup Errors:**  Carefully examine the output in the Replit console.  Does the server start? Do you see any errors?  Copy and paste the output.

    *   **Test `/api/health`:**  If the server starts, try to access the `/api/health` endpoint using the URL from Replit's Webview (e.g., `https://<your-replit-url>/api/health`).  Does it return `{"status": "ok"}`?

**2. If Step 1 Works (Server Starts and `/api/health` Works):**

*   This means the core Express server and database connection are *likely* working.  The problem is then *definitely* related to either:
    *   Vite's configuration.
    *   The interaction between Vite and your React code (e.g., incorrect API URLs in the client).
    *   CORS:
        * Add this to your `server/index.ts`
              ```ts
              import cors from 'cors';

              const allowedOrigins = ['http://localhost:5173', 'https://1437b402-c753-46c4-ab96-0e0234bae53b-00-1vlomg3cflyir.spock.replit.dev'];

              const corsOptions = {
                origin: function (origin: any, callback: any) {
                  if (!origin || allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
                    callback(null, true)
                  } else {
                    callback(new Error('Not allowed by CORS'))
                  }
                },
                credentials: true
              };

              app.use(cors(corsOptions));
              ```

**3. If Step 1 Fails (Server Still Doesn't Start):**

*   We need to examine the console output *very* carefully for errors.  There's likely a problem with:
    *   Database connection (check `DATABASE_URL` again).
    *   A syntax error or other problem in your server code that we haven't caught yet.
    *  Some Replit-specific issue (less likely, but possible).

**Action Plan (Right Now):**

1.  **Perform Step 1 (Bypass Vite):** Make the changes to `server/index.ts` and run `tsx server/index.ts`.
2.  **Report Back:**
    *   **Console Output:** Copy and paste the *entire* output from the Replit console.
    *   **`/api/health` Test:**  Report whether you can access `/api/health` and what the result is.
    * **Webview URL:** Double check that URL.

Let's get the basic server running directly. That will significantly narrow down the problem.  We are *not* giving up; we're just simplifying to isolate the issue.

Re-enable Vite (Carefully):

Undo the temporary changes: In server/index.ts, undo the changes we made in the last step. That means:

Uncomment the lines:

import { setupVite, serveStatic } from "./vite";
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
and

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  await setupVite(app, server);
} else {
  serveStatic(app);
}
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
Ensure that you have removed all of the placeholder routes that you added previously.

Save server/index.ts.

Re-verify vite.config.ts (CRITICAL):

Make absolutely sure your vite.config.ts file is exactly as follows (this is the corrected version from our earlier discussion):

import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import themePlugin from "@replit/vite-plugin-shadcn-theme-json";
import path, { dirname } from "path";
import runtimeErrorOverlay from "@replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal";
import { fileURLToPath } from "url";

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = dirname(__filename);

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), runtimeErrorOverlay(), themePlugin()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "@db": path.resolve(__dirname, "db"),
      "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "client", "src"),
    },
  },
  root: path.resolve(__dirname, "client"),
  build: {
    outDir: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist/public"),
    emptyOutDir: true,
  },
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Listen on all addresses, including LAN and public IPs
        port: 5173,     // Explicitly set Vite's dev server port
        hmr: false,      // disables hot reloading
        origin: `https://${process.env.REPL_SLUG}.${process.env.REPL_OWNER}.repl.co`
  },
});
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
origin: The origin should not be hard coded, but use the Repl environment variables.

Save vite.config.ts.

Run npm run dev: Start the server again using the Replit "Run" button (or npm run dev in the shell).

Wait and Observe: Give it at least 60 seconds. Replit can be slow to update.

Check Webview and Browser Console

Use replit's webview to view your application.

Open your browser's developer tools (F12). Go to the "Console" tab and look for any errors. Copy and paste them.

Go to the "Network" tab. Refresh the page. Look for any requests that have a red status (400s, 500s). Click on those requests, and look at the "Response" tab. Copy and paste the response.

This kind of problem is often caused by a mismatch between what the client expects and what the server actually returns. In your case, in the delete handler within your **ProductCard** component, you call:

```tsx
const response = await apiRequest("DELETE", `/api/products/${product.id}`);
const result = await response.json();
if (result.error) {
  throw new Error(result.error);
}
```

If your DELETE endpoint on the server returns no content (for example, a **204 No Content** status with an empty body), then calling `response.json()` will throw an error because there isn’t any JSON to parse. That error gets caught and ends up showing your toast error message ("Failed to delete product. Please try again.") even though the deletion might have succeeded on the database.

### What You Can Do

1. **Server-Side:**  
   Update your DELETE endpoint so that it returns a JSON response (even if it’s just an empty object or a success message). For example, if you’re using Express you might do something like this:
   ```js
   app.delete('/api/products/:id', async (req, res) => {
     // Delete the product from the database...
     // If deletion is successful, respond with a JSON object:
     res.status(200).json({ success: true });
   });
   ```
   This way, the client’s call to `await response.json()` will correctly parse the returned JSON.

2. **Client-Side:**  
   Alternatively, you can modify your client’s deletion code to handle an empty response. For instance, you might check the status code before attempting to parse JSON:
   ```tsx
   const deleteProduct = useCallback(async (e?: React.MouseEvent) => {
     e?.stopPropagation();
     try {
       const response = await apiRequest("DELETE", `/api/products/${product.id}`);
       if (response.status === 204) {
         // No content, so assume deletion succeeded.
         await Promise.all([
           queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["/api/products"] }),
           queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["/api/watchlist"] })
         ]);
         toast({
           title: "Product removed",
           description: "The product has been removed from your inventory",
         });
         return;
       }
       // If there is a body, parse it.
       const result = await response.json();
       if (result.error) {
         throw new Error(result.error);
       }
       await Promise.all([
         queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["/api/products"] }),
         queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["/api/watchlist"] })
       ]);
       toast({
         title: "Product deleted",
         description: product.name,
       });
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Product deletion failed:', error);
       toast({
         title: "Error",
         description: "Failed to delete product. Please try again.",
         variant: "destructive",
       });
     }
   }, [product.id, product.name, toast]);
   ```
   This way, if the server returns a **204 No Content** (or otherwise an empty body), you won’t try to parse it as JSON and will treat it as a success.

3. **Other Considerations:**  
   Although the JSON parsing issue is the most likely culprit, also verify that:
   - Your server’s DELETE route is correctly implemented.
   - There are no unexpected foreign key constraints (e.g. from order items) that might block the deletion. In your schema, you’re using `onDelete: 'set null'` or `cascade` appropriately, so that should be fine.
   - Your API authentication and permissions are set correctly so that the user is allowed to delete the product.

### Conclusion

Review your DELETE endpoint and the client’s handling of its response. Ensuring that the endpoint returns valid JSON (or that your client safely handles an empty response) will likely resolve the issue of products not being “successfully deleted” from the client’s perspective.

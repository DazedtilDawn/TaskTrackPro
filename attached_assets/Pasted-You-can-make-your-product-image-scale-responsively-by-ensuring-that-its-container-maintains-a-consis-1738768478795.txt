You can make your product image scale responsively by ensuring that its container maintains a consistent aspect ratio and that the image itself fills that container with the correct object-fit rules. Here are a few approaches:

### 1. **Using Tailwind’s Utility Classes**

If you’d like a quick solution, you can set up a container that enforces a fixed height and use the `object-cover` class so the image fills the container without distorting its aspect ratio. For example:

```tsx
<div className="relative w-full h-48">
  <img
    src={product.imageUrl}
    alt={product.name}
    className="w-full h-full object-cover"
  />
</div>
```

In this example, the container has a fixed height (`h-48`), and the image scales to fill the container while keeping its aspect ratio.

### 2. **Using an Aspect Ratio Container**

A more flexible solution is to wrap the image in a container that maintains a given aspect ratio. Tailwind CSS v3+ provides built‑in aspect ratio utilities (or you can use your custom `<AspectRatio>` component). For example:

```tsx
import { AspectRatio } from "@/components/ui/aspect-ratio";

{product.imageUrl && (
  <AspectRatio ratio={16 / 9} className="w-full">
    <img
      src={product.imageUrl}
      alt={product.name}
      className="object-cover w-full h-full"
    />
  </AspectRatio>
)}
```

Here, the `AspectRatio` component (or Tailwind’s `aspect-video` class if you prefer) forces the container to maintain a 16:9 ratio. The image then fills that space with `object-cover`, ensuring it scales properly regardless of the actual image dimensions.

### 3. **Responsive Adjustments by View**

If your card is used in multiple views (grid, list, table), you might want to conditionally adjust the container classes. For example:

```tsx
<div className={cn("relative", view === "grid" ? "w-full" : "w-48 shrink-0")}>
  {view === "grid" ? (
    <AspectRatio ratio={16 / 9} className="w-full">
      <img src={product.imageUrl} alt={product.name} className="object-cover w-full h-full" />
    </AspectRatio>
  ) : (
    <img src={product.imageUrl} alt={product.name} className="w-48 h-full object-cover" />
  )}
</div>
```

This snippet uses an aspect ratio container for grid views while using fixed dimensions in other views.

### Summary

- **Maintain Aspect Ratio:** Use an aspect ratio container (via Tailwind’s utilities or a custom component) so that the image area scales while preserving its ratio.
- **Object Fit:** Ensure the image has the `object-cover` class so it fills the container without stretching.
- **Responsive Classes:** Adjust your width/height classes based on the view mode to keep your layout consistent.

By using these techniques, you can have your product image scale properly on the card without having fixed pixel sizes that might not work well across devices. Let me know if you need further adjustments or additional guidance!
